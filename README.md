# LMU OSC Organization Backup

The code in this repo is intended to hit the GitHub API for all of our organization repos so that we can create backups of all of the code, pull requests, issues, and related metadata for all of our repos. This is mostly a worst-case, disaster back-up in case someone were to e.g. get access to our organization and delete all of the content online. Then, we would have local back-ups of our content also available.
